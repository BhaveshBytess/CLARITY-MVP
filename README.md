# **Clarity – Your Self-Growth AI Copilot**

> **Know what matters. Do what matters.**
> Clarity is an AI-assisted personal dashboard that helps you track your growth, overcome perfection loops, stay aware of opportunities, and focus on what truly matters.

## **Problem Statement**

Many students and professionals struggle with:

1. **Perfection Paradox** – Over-consuming information and delaying execution.
2. **Awareness Gap** – Missing deadlines, events, and opportunities due to lack of timely updates.
3. **Scattered Tracking** – Goals, habits, and emotional well-being spread across multiple tools, making it hard to see the full picture.

**Clarity** solves this by acting as a **single intelligent hub** that tracks your progress, understands your mental patterns, and gives actionable, data-backed suggestions every day.

---

## **MVP Goal**

> Build a functional self-growth assistant in **4 weeks** that:

* Tracks and analyzes progress across **3 growth pillars** (Dev, DSA, GATE).
* Reads and interprets daily journals for **mood trends & recurring themes**.
* Detects **perfection loops** and alerts the user.
* Scrapes and displays relevant **ML/AI opportunities** with deadlines.
* Generates **one actionable suggestion** each day based on the user’s data.

---

## **Features**

* **Goal Tracker AI** – Log daily hours for your 3 growth pillars and get smart suggestions if you’re falling behind.
* **Journal Analyzer** – Analyze your daily journal for mood trends & recurring themes.
* **Perfection Loop Detector** – Detects over-research & lack of execution.
* **Opportunity Awareness Engine** – Stay updated on relevant events, internships, and contests.
* **Suggestions Hub** – One daily actionable focus point based on your data.
